## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Netflix is a global streaming giant, but in a market with fierce competition from Disney+, Amazon Prime, and others, strategic content decisions are crucial. This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to uncover trends in its content library and provide actionable recommendations.

The primary goal is to answer the question: **What content should Netflix focus on next?** We do this by analyzing:
- The distribution of **Movies vs. TV Shows** over time.
- The most **popular genres** and their growth.
- The **top content-producing countries** to identify key markets.

The insights from this analysis are intended for Netflix's content acquisition, production, and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions.
